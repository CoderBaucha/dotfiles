Config files for i3-gaps window manager and vim text editor.

Still a work in progress; ricing is a tedious and time-consuming task in itself.
Vim's config files get updated much frequently compared to other config files, since I'm mostly using Vim for coding.

For the plugin files in Vim, I use Vundle, which can be set up by following this site:

https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim

For other plugins, I usually use the package manager in the Linux distro I use. If I don't find one on the repo, I simply clone it from Github.

Plugins used in this Vim config:

vim-airline (https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)

Nerdtree (https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree)

vim-surround (https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)

fzf (https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

syntastic (https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic)
