# dotfiles
Config files for i3-gaps window manager and vim text editor.

Still a work in progress; ricing is a tedious and time-consuming task in itself.

Update as of June 20, 2021:

I have moved my vimrc file to another repo. The reason why I moved vimrc to another repo was because I use vim regularly but I seldom use i3wm now, rather I use the default desktop environment of whatever distro I use. Also, having to clone vimrc on Windows too, and it makes no sense for me to clone dotfiles on Windows if I never have to use i3wm.
